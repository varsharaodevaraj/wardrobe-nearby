# Network Connectivity Fix - Summary & Next Steps

## 🔍 Problem Identified
The app was failing with "Network request failed" errors because:
- **Server was running on**: `192.168.13.145:3000` 
- **App was configured for**: `192.168.14.31:3000` (old IP address)

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Fixed API Configuration
- **Updated `.env.local`**: Changed IP from `192.168.14.31` to `192.168.13.145`
- **Enhanced `apiConfig.js`**: Added better IP validation and debugging
- **Improved `api.js`**: Added comprehensive network error messages

### 2. Added Debugging Tools
- **Created `networkTest.js`**: Network diagnostic utility
- **Added `NetworkTestComponent.js`**: UI component for testing connectivity
- **Temporarily added test component**: To HomeScreen for easy testing

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Better error messages when network requests fail
- Clear troubleshooting steps in console logs
- IP address validation and auto-detection

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Step 1: Restart Your App
The app needs to pick up the new `.env.local` configuration:

1. **Stop your current app** (Ctrl+C in the terminal where Expo is running)
2. **Clear Expo cache**: `npx expo start --clear`
3. **Restart the app** and reload it completely

### Step 2: Test Network Connectivity
Once the app reloads, you'll see a "Network Testing" section on the home screen:

1. **Tap "Test Basic Connection"** - This tests if the server is reachable
2. **Tap "Test Items API"** - This tests if the items endpoint works properly

### Step 3: Verify Server is Running
Make sure your server is still running:
```bash
cd WardrobeNearby-Server
npm start
```

You should see: `📱 Mobile access: http://192.168.13.145:3000`

### Step 4: Test Original Features
Once network tests pass, try your original features:
- Browse items on HomeScreen
- Click on an item to view details
- Try "Rent Now" and "Buy Now" buttons
- Verify custom message prompts work

## 🛠️ If Problems Persist

### Check Network Configuration
Run this to verify your network setup:
```bash
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
```

### Manual IP Check
If auto-detection isn't working, manually set the IP in `.env.local`:
```
REACT_NATIVE_API_URL=http://[YOUR_ACTUAL_IP]:3000/api
```

### Debug Console
Watch the app console for these helpful messages:
- `🚀 [API] Using dynamic API URL: ...`
- `🌐 [NETWORK_ERROR] Connection failed to: ...`
- `💡 [NETWORK_ERROR] Possible solutions:`

## 🧹 Cleanup (After Testing)
Once everything works, remove the temporary test component:

1. Remove `NetworkTestComponent` import from `HomeScreen.js`
2. Remove `<NetworkTestComponent />` from the render method
3. Delete `components/NetworkTestComponent.js` if no longer needed

## 📝 Files Modified
- `.env.local` - Updated IP address
- `config/apiConfig.js` - Enhanced with debugging
- `utils/api.js` - Better error messages
- `utils/networkTest.js` - New diagnostic utility
- `components/NetworkTestComponent.js` - New test component
- `screens/HomeScreen.js` - Temporarily added test component

---

**The main fix is updating the IP address in `.env.local`. Everything else is enhanced debugging to help prevent this issue in the future.**
